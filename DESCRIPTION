    Loop for Input/Output: read and write multiple files.
    Loop for models: make repetitive work easy e.g., comunity- and species- based variation partitioning; group species abundance matrix into abundant and rare species subcommunities etc.
    Loop for plots : functions makes visualization in ecological areas easier e.g.,get tidy data from models for visualization.
    Others: others usefull functions for daily work.
