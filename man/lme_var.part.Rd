see https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1608980113 for details of how this algorithm works.
"The function r.squaredGLMM from the MuMIn-package (67) was used to calculate the marginal (fixed effects) and conditional
 (full model) R2 for all optimal and beyond-optimal models. We then followed a variation partitioning procedure to determine
 the relative proportion of variation for each response variable in the models with elevation, GDD, and plot productivity.
 To perform our variation partitioning, we constructed a series of models with (i) only one focal variable,
 (ii) all variables except that focal variable, or (iii) the full model with all explanatory variables.
 The proportion of variation explained by each fixed factor was represented by calculating the difference between
 the marginal R2 of the full model and of the model without the focal variable and dividing it by the marginal R2
  of the full model (68). For all factors in all models, the variation explained by the model without the focal variable
  (R2 of full model minus R2 of model with only the focal variable, divided by full model) and the shared variance
   (R2 of model of focal variable plus R2 of model without focal variable minus R2 of full model, divided by R2 of full model)
   were calculated as well (SI Appendix, Tables S7â€“S9). This variance partitioning could not be performed for the models
   of probability of flower production, because this probability was zero in the undisturbed subplots in the Scandes."
