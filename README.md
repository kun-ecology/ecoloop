# ecoloop
Loop for ecological data analysis

# Description

This package includes functions I developed that based on my PhD projects, which mainly concern stream ecology with a focus on biofilm. It covers the following aspects:

* Loop for **Input/Output**: read and write multiple files.

* Loop for **models**: make repetitive work easy e.g., comunity- and species- based variation partitioning; group species abundance matrix into abundant and rare species subcommunities etc.

* Loop for **plots** : functions makes visualization in ecological areas easier e.g.,get tidy data from models for visualization.

* Others: others usefull functions for daily work. 

# NOTE
* This package is mainly for my own convenience, so i do not guarantee it will work with your PC and your data sets. But feel free to contact me, I can help whenever possible.

* Feel free to use and modify.

* If you find some of the functions usefull, you are also welcome to cite it.
