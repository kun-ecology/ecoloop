```

This package contains miscellaneous functions I developed during my daily work. 
It mainly covers following aspects:

- Loop for **Input/Output**: read and write multiple files.

- Loop for **models**: make repetitive work easy e.g., comunity- and species- based variation partitioning; group species abundance matrix into abundant and rare species subcommunities etc.

- Loop for **plots** : functions makes visualization in ecological areas easier e.g.,get tidy data from models for visualization.

- Others: other functions. 

# Notes

* Please note that this package is mainly for my own convenience, so i do not guarantee it will work on your PC and with your data sets. But feel free to contact me, I will try to help whenever possible.

* Feel free to use and modify.

* If you find some of the functions useful, you are also welcome to cite it.
